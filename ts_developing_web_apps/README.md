## What is TS?

- TS is an object-oriented compiler language

- It's a superset of JavaScript and is compiled into JavaScript

- In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features. It's both a language and a set of tools

## Features of TS

- TS is just JavaScript; it starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript

- It adopts the basic building blocks of your program for JavaScript. All TS code is converted into JS equivalent execution.

- It supports other Js libraries

- TS-generated JS can reuse existing JS Frameworks, tools and libraries.

- Any .js file can be renamed to .ts and compiled with the TS files.

- It's portable across browsers, devices and operating systems

- It can run on any JS environment and does not need a reliable VM or a specific runtime environment to execute.
