## What is TS?

- TS is an object-oriented compiler language

- It's a superset of JavaScript and is compiled into JavaScript

- In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features. It's both a language and a set of tools

---

## Features of TS

- TS is just JavaScript; it starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript

- It adopts the basic building blocks of your program for JavaScript. All TS code is converted into JS equivalent execution.

- It supports other Js libraries

- TS-generated JS can reuse existing JS Frameworks, tools and libraries.

- Any .js file can be renamed to .ts and compiled with the TS files.

- It's portable across browsers, devices and operating systems

- It can run on any JS environment and does not need a reliable VM or a specific runtime environment to execute.

## Why use TS?

TS is superior to its other replicas, like CoffeScript and Dart programming languages, because TS is advanced JS.

The benefits are:

- compilation

- strong static typing

- TS supports type definitions for existing JS libraries.

- It supports OOPs concepts like: classes, interfaces, inheritance, etc.

---

## Pre requisites:

- Must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm installed. To verify Nodejs on the system: `node -v`

- Must have TypeScript, if not, you can install with: `npm install -g typescript`

---

##TypeScript Types

- Different types of values are supported by the TS language.

- It offers JS data types so that it can became a strongly types programming language

- Data type are an optional Type System that TS offers. The TypeScript data type an be categorized as follows:

`static - generic - decorator`

- **static**: of two types...

...**built-in / primitive** like: number, void (the return type for functions that don't return any kind of value), string, null (a variable with an unknown value) and boolean (true or false) 

...**user defined data type** like: array (a group of elements), class (serve as a model for building objects and are used to build reusable components), touple (contain two sets of values of various data kind), enum, interface (a structure that serves as a contract for uor application), functions


- **generic**: is used to design components that can function with a range of types. T it's used to represent a generic.

- **decorator**: an accessor, method, property and parameter can all have decorators attached to them. It's a specific sort of data. Use the "@"

- **type assertion**
